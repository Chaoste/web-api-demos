# web-api-demos

A demonstration of the latest web APIs

## Ideas

- Copy (Demo: copy button, show code between back in the days and nowadays)
- Sensors (Demo: show a 3d cube and allow rotating it)
- Speech Recognition (Demo: access the microphone and write on screen)
- Text to speech (Demo: read out the recorded stuff)
- Server Sent Events
- Share API (Demo: share link to this page)

Optional: PWA, Battery, Server Sent Events, Geolocation (Demo: show a map and the users position on it)

## TODO

- Router
- Demonstrate on peoples phones
- Render code snippets in the app
- Carousel
